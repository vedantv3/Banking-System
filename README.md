# Banking management system

## question

Develop a banking system using C++ console application that allows users to manage their accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, apply for loans, and detect and prevent fraud. The system should be secure and use encryption to protect users' personal and financial information. Additionally, the system should generate reports and analytics on account transactions, user behavior, and other key metrics.

Your project should be well documented with clear and concise explanations of the system architecture, design, and implementation details. You should also include user manuals and technical documentation to help users and developers understand how to use and maintain the system.

### **To successfully complete this project, you should:**

**Design the system architecture:** Develop a high-level overview of the system, including the classes, data structures, and functions.

**Develop the user interface:** Create a user-friendly interface using the console, that allows users to manage their accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, apply for loans, and detect and prevent fraud.
 
**Implement the system functionality:** Write the code to implement the system functionality, including user registration and login, account management, deposit and withdrawal, transfer funds, bill payment, loan management, fraud detection, security, reporting, analytics, and customer support.

**Test the system:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the system is functioning as intended, and address any issues or bugs that arise during testing.

**Document the system:** Provide clear and concise documentation that explains the system architecture, design, implementation details, and user manuals.

By the end of this project, you should have a functional banking system in C++ console application that meets the requirements outlined above, as well as thorough documentation that explains the system's functionality and usage.
